# Ghost 4s Quick Review

The Ghost 4s is a cartesian printer, which means the head is moving along an X,Y plane, while the plate, where you can print, is moving only along the Z axis

The advantage brought by this design is faster print speed and improved stability of the printer, due to the only moving part being the print head

Despite a generous print volume, with 255mmx210mmx210mm (x,y,z), it is still fairly small (dimensions: 392mm x 342mm x 420mm)

The structure of the printer is made of metal, while the panels, which enclose the printing area laterally and at the back, are made of acrylic

This kind of setup makes it really easy to build a complete enclosure, making it perfect to keep the heath for printing more complicated materials, like ABS, Nylon or ASA

One of the best features of the Ghost 4S is the Ultrabase plate, which, thanks to the micro pores, guarantees perfect adhesion while hot and completely releases prints when it's completely cooled down

The extruder is a BMG Bondtech dual drive clone, maybe not the best you can find on the market, but easily replaceable with a superior one

The list of features is completed by a wonderful touch screen, a filament runout sensor and Wi-Fi connectivity
