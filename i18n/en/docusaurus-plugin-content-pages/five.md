# Ghost 5 Quick Review

The Ghost 5 is a cartesian printer, which means the head is moving along an X,Y plane, while the plate, where you can print, is moving only along the Z axis

The advantage brought by this design is faster print speed and improved stability of the printer, due to the only moving part being the print head

Despite a generous print volume, with 255mmx210mmx210mm (x,y,z), it is still fairly small (dimensions: 388mm x 337mm x 411mm)

The structure of the printer is made of metal, while the panels, which enclose the printing area laterally and at the back, are made of acrylic

This kind of setup makes it really easy to build a complete enclosure, making it perfect to keep the heath for printing more complicated materials, like ABS, Nylon or ASA

One of the best features of the Ghost 4S is the Ultrabase plate, which, thanks to the micro pores, guarantees perfect adhesion while hot and completely releases prints when it's completely cooled down

The extruder is a BMG Bondtech dual drive clone, maybe not the best you can find on the market, but easily replaceable with a superior one
Differently from the 4S, this one is transparent, giving a better visual feedback about the filament position and status

The motherboard is a rebrand of the MKS Robin Nano 1.1, although recently there have been many changes from Flyingbear:
- some motherboards have different chipsets (especially the robin nano 1.3 and 1.3S)
- some motherboards have two A4988 and two TMC2208 drivers, some have four TMC2208, some have four TMC 2225, directly soldered on the motherboard and not replaceable
- some motherboards come with dedicated pins for the BL Touch, most don't 

The printer is fairly quiet, although rectractions might be a bit noisy if you are the unlucky owner of a motherboard with A4988 drivers. But don't worry: you can easily replace them following the guide in the [TMC2209](/tmc2209) section!

The biggest sources of noise are the fans, which can be replaced with some more quiet ones, although you might have to compromise between cooling and noise

The list of features is completed by a wonderful touch screen, a filament runout sensor (to stop printing when running out of filament or filament breaks up) and Wi-Fi connectivity
